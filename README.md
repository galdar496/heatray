# Heatray 

## Overview

Heat Ray 3.0 is a raytracer/path tracer written in C++ and makes use of OpenRL (of which I was a developer) for all raytracing. It uses a progressive rendering algorithm that works in passes (with 1024 passes as the default).

Heat Ray 2.0 is a ray tracer/photon mapper written entirely in C++ with an OpenGL viewer. This version is still available under the original [google code repository page](https://code.google.com/p/heatray/downloads/list).
